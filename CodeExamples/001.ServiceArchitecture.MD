To find all nodes you can run the following TSQL in SSMS. 
```sql
SELECT  [pdw_node_id]   AS node_id
,       [type]          AS node_type
,       [name]          AS node_name
FROM    sys.[dm_pdw_nodes]
;
```

To find all distributions, you can fun the following TSQL in SSMS: 
```sql
SELECT  [distribution_id]   AS dist_id
,       [pdw_node_id]       AS node_id
,       [name]              AS dist_name
,       [position]          AS dist_position
FROM    sys.[pdw_distributions]
;
```

To check the current service objective, you can run the following TSQL in SSMS: 
```sql
SELECT  db.[name]              AS [db_name]
,       ds.[edition]           AS [db_edition]
,       ds.[service_objective] AS [db_slo]
FROM    sys.[database_service_objectives]   AS ds
JOIN    sys.[databases]                     AS db
ON      ds.[database_id] = db.[database_id]
WHERE   ds.[edition]   	= 'DataWarehouse'
;
```

To amend the current Service objective level, you can run the following Powershell in the Powershell ISE 
If this is your first time using PowerShell, you may need to run "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted" and also "Install-Module -Name AzureRM -AllowClobber"
```powershell
Set-AzureRmSqlDatabase 
	-DatabaseName “Database" 
	-ServerName “Server" 
	-RequestedServiceObjectiveName "DW1000"
```

To suspend Azure SQL Data Warehouse, you can run the following PowerShell in the Powershell ISE. 
```powershell
Suspend-AzureRmSqlDatabase 
–ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup"
–ServerName "Server" 
–DatabaseName "Database"
```

To Resume Azure SQL Data Warehouse, you can run the following PowerShell in the Powershell ISE. 
```powershell
Resume-AzureRmSqlDatabase 
	–ResourceGroupName 	"ResourceGroup"
	–ServerName "Server" 
	–DatabaseName "Database"

```

To collect infromation about SnapShots you can run the following TSQL in SSMS: 
```sql
SELECT  [run_id]                    AS bkup_run_id
,       [session_id]                AS session_id
,       [request_id]                AS request_id
,       [name]                      AS bkup_name
,       [submit_time]               AS bkup_submit_time
,       [start_time]                AS bkup_start_time
,       [end_time]                  AS bkup_end_time
,       [total_elapsed_time]        AS bkup_duration_ms
,       [total_elapsed_time]/1000.0 AS bkup_duration_sec
FROM    sys.pdw_loader_backup_runs
; 
```

To create a user in Azure SQL Data Warehouse there are 2 plpaces the users needs to be created. 
1. At the server level
2. At the database level 

```sql
-- Pre-req
CREATE USER data_loader FOR LOGIN data_loader
;
```

```sql
-- Add user to static rc
EXEC sp_addrolemember 'staticrc40','data_loader'
;
```

```sql
-- Remove user from static rc
EXEC sp_droprolemember 'staticrc40','data_loader'
;
```

That is all the code examples from the first deck.
