Code examples from deck 003. 

Using the IDENTITY property
```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.Dim1
(C1 INT IDENTITY(1,1)
,C2 INT
)
WITH
(DISTRIBUTION = HASH(C2)
,CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
)
;
```

Data vault key: Use HASHBYTES
```sql
DECLARE @i VARCHAR(8000) = REPLICATE('X',8000)
 
SELECT LOWER(CONVERT(CHAR(32),HASHBYTES('MD5',@i),2))
; 
SELECT 
LOWER(CONVERT(BIGINT,HASHBYTES('MD5',@i),2))
;
```

CREATE TABLE with partitions
```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[FactOnlineSales_PTN] 
(    [OnlineSalesKey]       int         NOT NULL 
,    [DateKey]              datetime    NOT NULL 
,    [StoreKey]             int         NOT NULL 
,    [ProductKey]           int         NOT NULL 
,    [CurrencyKey]          int         NOT NULL 
,    [SalesQuantity]        int         NOT NULL 
,    [SalesAmount]          money       NOT NULL 
,    [UnitPrice]            money           NULL 
)
WITH 
(   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
,   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([ProductKey])
,   PARTITION
    (
        [DateKey] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
        (
            '2007-01-01 00:00:00.000','2008-01-01 00:00:00.000'
        ,   '2009-01-01 00:00:00.000','2010-01-01 00:00:00.000'
        )
    )
)
;
```

Creating a partitioned table with CTAS
```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].FactOnlineSales_PTN
WITH
(   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
,   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([ProductKey])
,   PARTITION
    (
        [DateKey] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
        (
        	'2007-01-01 00:00:00.000','2008-01-01 00:00:00.000'
	 ,	'2009-01-01 00:00:00.000','2010-01-01 00:00:00.000'
        )
    )
)
AS
SELECT  *
FROM    [dbo].[FactOnlineSales]
;
```

Create a numbers table using the Itzik method. This is a 0 IO operation! It is pretty sweet. 
```sql
CREATE TABLE #Nums
WITH (DISTRIBUTION=REPLICATE,LOCATION=USER_DB)
AS
WITH    L0      AS (SELECT 1 AS c UNION ALL SELECT 1)
,       L1      AS (SELECT 1 AS c FROM L0 AS A, L0 AS B)
,       L2      AS (SELECT 1 AS c FROM L1 AS A, L1 AS B)
,       L3      AS (SELECT 1 AS c FROM L2 AS A, L2 AS B)
,       L4      AS (SELECT 1 AS c FROM L3 AS A, L3 AS B)
,       L5      AS (SELECT 1 AS c FROM L4 AS A, L4 AS B)
,       Nums    AS (SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY c) AS n FROM L5)
SELECT  CAST(n AS BIGINT) as Number
FROM    Nums   
WHERE   n BETWEEN @num_Start AND @num_End
OPTION (LABEL='fn_nums : #nums create')
;
```

UPSERTing data with CTAS
```sql
CREATE TABLE [tmp].[DimProduct]
WITH (DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN)
AS -- New rows and new versions of rows
SELECT      s.[ProductKey]
,           s.[ProductName]
,           s.[ColorName]
FROM        [src].[DimProduct] s
UNION ALL --Keep rows that are not being updated
SELECT      p.[ProductKey]
,           p.[ProductName]
,           p.[ColorName]
FROM        [dbo].[DimProduct] p
WHERE NOT EXISTS
(   SELECT *
    FROM   [src].[DimProduct] s
    WHERE  s.[ProductKey] = p.[ProductKey]
)
;
```

CTAS – Create partition for switch out
```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[FactOnlineSales_out]
WITH 
(   DISTRIBUTION=HASH ([ProductKey])
,   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
,   PARTITION ([DateKey] 
    RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES 	('2007-01-01 00:00:00.000'
					,'2008-01-01 00:00:00.000'
                           	)
              )
)
AS 
SELECT *
FROM   [dbo].[FactOnlineSales]
WHERE 1=2;
```

CTAS – Create Partition for Switch In
```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[FactOnlineSales_in]
WITH 
(   DISTRIBUTION=HASH ([ProductKey])
,   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
,   PARTITION ([DateKey] 
    RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES ('2007-01-01 00:00:00.000','2008-01-01 00:00:00.000'
                           )
              )
)
AS
SELECT *
FROM   [dbo].[FactOnlineSales_ptn] tgt
WHERE  tgt.[DateKey] >= '2007-01-01 00:00:00.000'
AND    tgt.[DateKey] <  '2008-01-01 00:00:00.000'
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM   [dbo].[FactOnlineSales] stg
WHERE stg.[DateKey] >= '2007-01-01 00:00:00.000'
AND   stg.[DateKey] <  '2008-01-01 00:00:00.000'
;

```

Perform the switches
```sql
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[FactOnlineSales_ptn] 
SWITCH PARTITION 2 
TO [dbo].[FactOnlineSales_out] PARTITION 2
;
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[FactOnlineSales_in] 
SWITCH  PARTITION 2 
TO [dbo].[FactOnlineSales_ptn] PARTITION 2
;

```

Upsert Logic – CTAS optimised
```sql
CREATE TABLE tmp.DimProduct
WITH (DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN)
AS -- New rows and new versions of rows
SELECT      s.ProductKey
,           s.ProductName
,           s.ColorName
FROM        [src].[DimProduct] s
WHERE       s.Operation IN ('I','U')
UNION ALL --Keep rows that are not being updated
SELECT      p.ProductKey
,           p.ProductName
,           p.ColorName
FROM        [dbo].[DimProduct] p
WHERE NOT EXISTS
(   SELECT *
    FROM   [src].[DimProduct] s
    WHERE  s.ProductKey = p.ProductKey
);
