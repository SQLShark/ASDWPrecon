Examples of aggregation compatibility
```sql
-- FactInternetSales distributed on ProductKey
SELECT      COUNT_BIG(*)
FROM        [ext].[FactResellerSales]
GROUP BY    [ProductKey]
;
SELECT  COUNT_BIG(DISTINCT ([ProductKey]))
FROM    [ext].[FactResellerSales]
;

```

Examples of aggregation incompatibility
```sql
-- FactInternetSales distributed on ProductKey
SELECT      COUNT_BIG(*)
FROM        [ext].[FactResellerSales]
GROUP BY    [StoreKey]
;
SELECT  COUNT_BIG(DISTINCT [DateKey])
FROM    [ext].[FactResellerSales]
;

Re-distribution example
```sql
--EXPLAIN
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[DimEmployee]
WITH (DISTRIBUTION = Hash(EmployeeKey))
AS
SELECT *
FROM   [ext].[DimEmployee]
OPTION (LABEL = 'CTAS : Redistribution')
;
```

COUNT DISTINCT examples
```sql
--EXPLAIN
SELECT  COUNT_BIG(DISTINCT [DateKey])
FROM    [ext].[FactInternetSales]
OPTION (LABEL = 'COUNT DISTINCT incompatible dist key')
;
--EXPLAIN
SELECT  COUNT_BIG(DISTINCT ([ProductKey]))
FROM    [ext].[FactInternetSales]
OPTION (LABEL = 'COUNT DISTINCT compatible dist key')
;

```

OVER() examples
```sql
--EXPLAIN
SELECT  SUM([SalesAmount]) OVER(PARTITION BY [DateKey])
FROM    [ext].[FactInternetSales]
OPTION (LABEL = 'OVER() incompatible dist key')
;
--EXPLAIN
SELECT  SUM([SalesAmount]) OVER(ORDER BY [ProductKey])
FROM    [dbo].[FactInternetSales]
OPTION (LABEL = 'OVER() incompatible no partition key')
;
--EXPLAIN
SELECT  SUM([SalesAmount]) OVER(PARTITION BY [ProductKey])
FROM    [dbo].[FactInternetSales]
OPTION (LABEL = 'OVER() compatible dist key')
;
